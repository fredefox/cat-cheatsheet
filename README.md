# cat-cheatseet
A cheat sheet for Awodey's Category Theory (2nd ed.)

I wan't to first collect the central definitions, lemmas etc. that we need to
know for the exam. Afterwards it might be nice to structure it a bit more,
perhaps as a mind-map.

Initially I've extracted concepts from each chapter (at this point I've mainly
just taken the concepts listed in the table of contents). I don't think that
this structure is necessarily the best one -- in fact I think this is one of the
biggest problems with the book, but this is also a difficult task. So if you
have suggestions please lemme know.
